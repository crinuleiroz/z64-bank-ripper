# Zelda64 Bank Ripper

## üîß How to Use
Drag and drop a decompressed Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask ROM onto the script or use the following CLI command:
```
python <script name> <ROM file>
```
The script will check the size of the ROM to ensure it is decompressed, then it will read the ROM's header to detect the game and extract the audio binary files at the correct offsets.

> [!NOTE]
> The output folder will be in the same folder as the script ‚Äî it will not be in the same folder as the input ROM file.

## üñ•Ô∏è ROM Decompression Utility
If you need to decompress a ROM, you can use [z64decompress](https://github.com/z64utils/z64decompress) by z64utils. Just drag and drop your ROM onto the executable (`.exe`) file.

## What is Extracted
The script only extracts banks whose length does not match the length of the origin game's bank at the given index. If you want to rip every single bank, make the following changes:

Comment out the block of code from line 151 to line 165:
```py
# Only extract banks whose length has changed
# Comment this block out and uncomment the block below if you
# want to extract all banks regardless of changes
if bank_lens[bank_index] != length:
  if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
    os.makedirs(output_dir)
  output_dir += "/"

  metadata = dma[8:16]
  bank_index_hex = hex(bank_index).lstrip("0x").zfill(2)
  filename = output_dir + bank_index_hex

  with open(f"{filename}.zbank", 'wb') as zbank:
    rom.seek(offset + address)
    zbank.write(rom.read(length))

  with open(f"{filename}.bankmeta", 'wb') as bankmeta:
    bankmeta.write(metadata)
```

And uncomment out the block of code from line 168 to line 183:
```py
# Extract all banks
# Uncomment this block and comment the block above if you
# want to extract all banks regardless of changes
if not os.path.exists(output_dir):
  os.makedirs(output_dir)
output_dir += "/"

metadata = dma[8:16]
bank_index_hex = hex(bank_index).lstrip("0x").zfill(2)
filename = output_dir + bank_index_hex

with open(f"{filename}.zbank", 'wb') as zbank:
  rom.seek(offset + address)
  zbank.write(rom.read(length))

with open(f"{filename}.bankmeta", 'wb') as bankmeta:
  bankmeta.write(metadata)
```
